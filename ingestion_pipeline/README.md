I might put my write up here

for now what I am going to try to do is setup a server that lets us grab data from the internet using an api

versioning with git

transformations and data tracking in git style? need to do this still?

allows us to hook up streaming

right now we chunk by paragraph but maybe we give option to chunk by data size?
